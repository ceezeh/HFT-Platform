This is a HFT platform project being built for learning. It has the following general features:

- Library, executable and test code separated in distinct folders
- Use of modern CMake for building and compiling
- External libraries installed and managed by
  - [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) Package Manager OR
  - [Conan](https://conan.io/) Package Manager OR
  - [VCPKG](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) Package Manager
- Unit testing using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) v2
- General purpose libraries: [JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog), [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts) and [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
- Continuous integration testing with Github Actions and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Code coverage reports, including automatic upload to [Codecov](https://codecov.io)
- Code documentation with [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) and [Github Pages](https://franneck94.github.io/CppProjectTemplate/)
- Tooling: Clang-Format, Cmake-Format, Clang-tidy, Sanitizers
